# Privacy Policy for LocalPDF Companion

**Last Updated: January 30, 2026**

LocalPDF Companion ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.

## 1. No Data Collection
**The Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.** 
- We do not track your browsing history.
- We do not collect information about the files you process.
- We do not use cookies or any tracking technologies.

## 2. Local Processing
All PDF processing (viewing, signing, OCR, etc.) initiated via the Extension happens **entirely on your local machine** within your browser's sandbox. 

If you choose to use the "Open in LocalPDF" feature, you are redirected to `localpdf.online`. Even then, processing on `localpdf.online` is designed to be privacy-first and happens locally in your browser.

## 3. Permissions Explained
- `activeTab`: Used to detect if you are currently viewing a PDF file to show the overlay.
- `storage`: Used only to remember the position of the draggable "SANCTUARY" button.
- `contextMenus`: Used to provide the "Open in LocalPDF" shortcut when right-clicking links.
- `host_permissions` (`<all_urls>`): Necessary to detect PDF files across different websites and to allow the extension to function correctly on any page where a PDF might be loaded.

## 4. Third-Party Services
The Extension does not share any information with third-party services.

## 5. Contact
